Defects Detection Interface in Python

in this project I worked on a desktop application using python that takes the picture and informations of a product that Hexcel Corporation produces, the picture of this product is saved and analyzed and the result is displayed on a high quality image with the lines of the contour and the different shapes in the product that are needed to be detected
in order to test the application you will need to put the product under the 2 cameras that I installed on a well designed table with certain dimensions that are precise in order to achieve the image stetching of the two images taken by the cameras.
the MAIN file is the file that has all the code, at first it was a jupyter source file, but later on i converted it to a python file, in order to make the modification easier for the quality manager.

to run the application you'll just need to run the MAIN file
